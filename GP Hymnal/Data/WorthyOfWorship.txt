Worthy of worship, worthy of praise,
Worthy of honor and glory,
Worthy of all the glad songs we can sing,
Worthy of all of the off’rings we bring.

You are worthy, Father, Creator;
You are worthy, Savior, Sustainer;
You are worthy, worthy and wonderful,
Worthy of worship and praise.

Worthy of reverence, worthy of fear,
Worthy of love and devotion,
Worthy of bowing and bending of knees,
Worthy of all this and added to these.

Almighty Father, Master and Lord,
King of all kings and Redeemer,
Wonderful Counselor, Comforter, Friend,
Savior and Source of our life without end.
