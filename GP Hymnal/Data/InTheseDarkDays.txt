In these dark days lift up your eyes to Jesus
Lift up your eyes Heâ€™s still upon the throne
And come what may, He never will forsake you
For He is God to Him all things are known

Lift up your eyes He still is there
Be not dismayed He knows your weight of care
In these dark days lift up your eyes to Jesus
And trust in Him He will your burden bear.
