Would you be free from the burden of sin?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
There's wonderful power in the blood

Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
There's wonderful power in the blood

Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There's power in the blood, power in the blood
Would you live daily His praises to sing
There's wonderful power in the blood
