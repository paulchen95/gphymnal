O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer’s praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

The name of Jesus calms my fears,
and bids my sorrows cease;
‘Tis music in the sinner’s ears;
‘Tis life and health and peace.

He breaks the pow’r of cancelled sin,
He sets the pris’ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

To God all glory praise,
And love be now and ever given
By saints below and saints above,
The church in earth and heaven.
