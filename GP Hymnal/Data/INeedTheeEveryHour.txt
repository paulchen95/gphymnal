I need Thee ev’ry hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

I need Thee, O I need Thee;
Ev’ry hour I need Thee!
O bless me now, my Savior,
I come to Thee.

I need Thee ev’ry hour,
Stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their pow’r
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee ev’ry hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

I need Thee ev’ry hour,
Teach me Thy will;
Thy promises so rich
In me fulfill.

I need Thee ev’ry hour,
Most Holy One;
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.
