This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas –
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world, O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the ruler yet.
This is my Father’s world:
The battle is not done;
Jesus who died shall be satisfied
And earth and heaven be one.

This is my Father’s world, should my heart be ever sad?
The Lord is King, let the heavens ring.
God reigns, let the earth be glad.
This is my Father’s world:
Now closer to Heaven bound,
For dear to God is the earth Christ trod
No place but is holy ground.

This is my Father’s world, I walk a desert lone
In a bush ablaze to my wondering gaze
God makes His glory known.
This is my Father’s world:
A wanderer I may roam
Whate’er my lot, it matters not,
My heart is still at home.
