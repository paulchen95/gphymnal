text::
Be still, my soul! The Lord is on your side;
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
Leave to your God to order and provide;
In every change, He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul! Your best, your heavenly Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul! Your God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past;
Your hope, your confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul! The waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul! Though dearest friends depart
And all is darkened in the vale of tears;
Then shall you better know His love, His heart,
Who comes to soothe your sorrows and your fears.
Be still, my soul! Your Jesus can repay
From His own fullness all He takes away.

Be still, my soul! The hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul! When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
