Let your heart be broken for a world in need;
Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed;
Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread;
Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.

Here on earth applying principles of love,
Visible expression God still rules above;
Living illustration of the Living Word
To the minds of all who’ve never seen or heard.

Blest to be a blessing, privileged to care,
Challenged by the need apparently everywhere,
Where mankind is wanting fill the vacant place,
Be the means thru which the Lord Reveals His grace.

Add to your believing, deeds that prove it true;
Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too;
Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;
In the world's great trouble, risk yourself for God.

Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;
See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near;
Let your heart be broken by another's pain;
Share your rich resources, give and give again.
