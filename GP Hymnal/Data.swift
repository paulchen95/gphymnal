        Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
        Heaven’s morning breaks and earth’s vain shadows flee;
        In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

        Until all on the altar we lay;
        For the favor He shows
        And the joy He bestows

        Then in fellowship sweet,
        We will sit at His feet
        Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
        What He says we will do,

        Never fear, only trust and obey.

        I heard an old, old story,
        How a Savior came from glory,
        How he gave His life on Calvary
        To save a wretch like me.
        I heard about His groaning,
        Of His precious blood’s atoning,
        Then I repented of my sins
        And won the victory.

        O victory in Jesus, my Savior, forever,
        He sought me and bought me
        With His redeeming blood;
        He loved me ere I knew Him,
        And all my love is due Him,
        He plunged me to victory,
        Beneath the cleansing flood.

        I heard about His healing,
        Of His cleansing power revealing,
        How He made the lame to walk again
        And caused the blind to see;
        And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
        Come and heal my broken spirit,”
        And somehow Jesus came
        And brought to me the victory.

        I heard about a mansion
        He has built for me in glory,
        And I heard about the streets of gold
        Beyond the crystal sea;
        About the angels singing,
        And the old redemption story,
        And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
        The song of victory.
