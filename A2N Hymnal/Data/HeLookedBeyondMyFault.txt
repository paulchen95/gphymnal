Amazing grace
Shall always be my song of praise
For it was grace that bought my liberty
I do not know just why
He came to love me so
He looked beyond my fault
And saw my need

I shall forever lift mine eyes to Calvary
To view the cross where Jesus died for me
How marvelous
The grace that caught my falling soul
He looked beyond my fault
And saw my need
