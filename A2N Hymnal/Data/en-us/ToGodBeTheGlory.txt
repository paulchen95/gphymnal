text::
To God be the glory, great things He hath done;
So loved He the world that He gave us His son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

[Refrain]
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory,
Great things He hath done.

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To ev’ry believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our vict’ry, when Jesus we see.
