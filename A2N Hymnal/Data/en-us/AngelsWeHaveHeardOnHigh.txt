text::
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains:
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.

[Refrain]
Gloria in excelsis Deo!
Gloria in excelsis Deo!

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King.

See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.
