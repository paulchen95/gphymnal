I saw the cross of Jesus,
When burdened with my sin;
I sought the cross of Jesus,
To give me peace within;
I brought my soul to Jesus,
He cleansed it in His blood;
And in the cross of Jesus
I found my peace with God.

I love the cross of Jesus,
It tells me what I am—
A vile and guilty creature,
Saved only through the Lamb;
No righteousness nor merit,
No beauty can I plead;
Yet in the cross I glory,
My title there I read.

I trust the cross of Jesus,
In every trying hour,
My sure and certain refuge,
My never failing tower;
In every fear and conflict,
I more than conqueror am;
Living, I’m safe, or dying,
Through Christ, the risen Lamb.

Safe in the cross of Jesus!
There let my weary heart
Still rest in peace unshaken,
Till with Him, ne’er to part;
And then in strains of glory
I’ll sing His wondrous power,
Where sin can never enter,
And death is known no more.
