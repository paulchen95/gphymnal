text::
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine
Living with Jesus, a new life divine
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine

[Refrain]
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love
Moment by moment I’ve life from above
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine

Never a trial that He is not there
Never a burden that He doth not bear
Never a sorrow that He doth not share
Moment by moment, I’m under His care

Never a weakness that He doth not feel
Never a sickness that He cannot heal
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal
Jesus my Savior abides with me still
