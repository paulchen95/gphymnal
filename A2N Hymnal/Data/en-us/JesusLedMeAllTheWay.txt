text::
Someday life's journey will be o'er,
And I shall reach that distant shore.
I'll sing while ent'ring heaven's door,
"Jesus led me all the way."

[Refrain]
Jesus led me all the way,
Led me step by step each day;
I will tell the saints and angels
as I lay my burdens down,
"Jesus led me all the way."

If God should let me there review,
The winding paths of earth I knew.
It would be proven clear and true â€”
Jesus led me all the way.

And hither to my Lord hath led,
Today He guides each step I tread;
And soon in heav'n it will be said,
"Jesus led me all the way."
