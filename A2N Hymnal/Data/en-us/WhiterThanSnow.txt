text::
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever to ransom my soul.
Break down every idol, cast out every foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

[Refrain]
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow.
Now wash me, and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat,
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet.
By faith, for my cleansing, I see Thy blood flow,
Now wash me, and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, Thou knowest I patiently wait,
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee,
Thou never saidst "No,"
Now wash me, and I shall be
Whiter than snow.
