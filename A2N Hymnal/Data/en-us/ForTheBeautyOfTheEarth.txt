For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which even from our birth
Over and around us lies

For the wonder of each hour
Of the day and of the night
Every hill and valley tree and flower
Sun and moon and stars of light

[Refrain]
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Lord of all to Thee we raise
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
This our song of grateful praise

For the joy of human love
Brother, sister, parent, child
All our friends on earth and friend above
For all gentle thoughts and mild

And for You, best Gift divine
To our world, so freely givâ€™n
For that great and wondrous love of Thine
Peace on earth and joy in heaven

[Tag]
This our song of grateful praise
Lord, receive our grateful praise
