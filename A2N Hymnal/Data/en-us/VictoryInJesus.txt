I heard an old, old story,
How a Savior came from glory,
How he gave His life on Calvary
To save a wretch like me.
I heard about His groaning,
Of His precious blood’s atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
And won the victory.

[Refrain]
O victory in Jesus, my Savior, forever,
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him,
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing power revealing,
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, “Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,”
And somehow Jesus came
And brought to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
The song of victory.
