“Take up thy cross and follow Me,”
I heard my Master say;
“I gave My life to ransom thee,
Surrender your all today.”

[Refrain]
Wherever He leads, I’ll go,
Wherever He leads, I’ll go,
I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so,
Wherever He leads, I’ll go.

He drew me closer to His side,
I sought His will to know,
And in that will I now abide,
Wherever He leads, I’ll go.

It may be through the shadows dim,
Or o’er the stormy sea,
I take my cross and follow Him,
Wherever He leadeth me.

My heart, my life, my all I bring
To Christ who loves me so;
He is my Master, Lord, and King,
Wherever He leads, I’ll go.
