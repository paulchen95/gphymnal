text::
We are called to be God’s people,
Showing by our lives His grace,
One in heart and one in sprit,
Sign of hope for all the race.
Let us show how He has changed us,
And remade us as His own,
Let us share our life together
As we shall around His throne.

We are called to be God’s servants,
Working in His world today,
Taking His own task upon us,
All His sacred words obey.
Let us rise, then, to His summons,
Dedicate to Him our all,
That we may be faithful servants,
Quick to answer now His call.

We are called to be God’s prophets,
Speaking for the truth and right,
Standing firm for godly justice,
Bringing evil into light.
Let us seek the courage needed,
Our high calling to fulfill,
That we all may know the blessing
Of the doing of God’s will.
