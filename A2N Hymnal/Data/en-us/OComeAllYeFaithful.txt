O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!

[Refrain]
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord!

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
O sing, all ye bright hosts of heav'n above!
Glory to God, all glory in the highest!

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning.
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
