O what a wonderful, wonderful day—
Day I will never forget;
After I’d wandered in darkness away
Jesus my Savior I met.
O what a tender, compassionate friend—
He met the need of my heart;
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart!

[Refrain]
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross the Savior made me whole;
My sins were washed away,
And my night was turned to day—
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God's fam’ly divine,
Justified fully through Calvary's love,
Oh, what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer,
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure,
There in those mansions sublime;
And it's because of that wonderful day
When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From His precious hand I received.
