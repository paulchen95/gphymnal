Spirit of the living God
Fall fresh on me
Spirit of the living God
Fall fresh on me
Break me, melt me, mold me, fill me
Spirit of the living God
Fall fresh on me

Soul of heaven, heart of God,
Wash over me.
Soul of heaven, heart of God,
Wash over me.
Cleanse me, teach me, hold me, reach me.
Soul of heaven, heart of God
Wash over me.

Holy presence, love divine,
Cast out my fear.
Holy presence, love divine,
Cast out my fear.
Shield me, free me, call me, lead me.
Holy presence, love divine, cast out my fear.
