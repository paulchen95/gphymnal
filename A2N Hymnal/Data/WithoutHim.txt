text::
Without Him, I could do nothing;
Without Him, I’d surely fail;
Without Him, I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail.

Jesus, O Jesus,
Do you know Him today?
Do not turn Him away.
O Jesus, O Jesus,
Without Him, how lost I would be.

Without Him, I would be dying;
Without Him, I’d be enslaved;
Without Him, life would be hopeless,
But with Jesus, thank God, I’m saved.
